# Editor Support[¶](<https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/editor-support/#editor-support> "Permanent link")

The official [FastAPI Extension](<https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=FastAPILabs.fastapi-vscode>) enhances your FastAPI development workflow with _path operation_ discovery, navigation, as well as FastAPI Cloud deployment, and live log streaming.

For more details about the extension, refer to the README on the [GitHub repository](<https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi-vscode>).

## Setup and Installation[¶](<https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/editor-support/#setup-and-installation> "Permanent link")

The **FastAPI Extension** is available for both [VS Code](<https://code.visualstudio.com/>) and [Cursor](<https://www.cursor.com/>). It can be installed directly from the Extensions panel in each editor by searching for "FastAPI" and selecting the extension published by **FastAPI Labs**. The extension also works in browser-based editors such as [vscode.dev](<https://vscode.dev>) and [github.dev](<https://github.dev>).

### Application Discovery[¶](<https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/editor-support/#application-discovery> "Permanent link")

By default, the extension will automatically discover FastAPI applications in your workspace by scanning for files that instantiate `FastAPI()`. If auto-detection doesn't work for your project structure, you can specify an entrypoint via `[tool.fastapi]` in `pyproject.toml` or the `fastapi.entryPoint` VS Code setting using module notation (e.g. `myapp.main:app`).

## Features[¶](<https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/editor-support/#features> "Permanent link")

  * **Path Operation Explorer** \- A sidebar tree view of all _path operations_ in your application. Click to jump to any route or router definition.
  * **Route Search** \- Search by path, method, or name with `Ctrl` \+ `Shift` \+ `E` (on macOS: `Cmd` \+ `Shift` \+ `E`).
  * **CodeLens Navigation** \- Clickable links above test client calls (e.g. `client.get('/items')`) that jump to the matching _path operation_ for quick navigation between tests and implementation.
  * **Deploy to FastAPI Cloud** \- One-click deployment of your app to [FastAPI Cloud](<https://fastapicloud.com/>).
  * **Stream Application Logs** \- Real-time log streaming from your FastAPI Cloud-deployed application with level filtering and text search.

If you'd like to familiarize yourself with the extension's features, you can check out the extension walkthrough by opening the Command Palette (`Ctrl` \+ `Shift` \+ `P` or on macOS: `Cmd` \+ `Shift` \+ `P`) and selecting "Welcome: Open walkthrough..." and then choosing the "Get started with FastAPI" walkthrough.
