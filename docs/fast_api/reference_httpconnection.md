# `HTTPConnection` class[¶](<https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/reference/httpconnection/#httpconnection-class> "Permanent link")

When you want to define dependencies that should be compatible with both HTTP and WebSockets, you can define a parameter that takes an `HTTPConnection` instead of a `Request` or a `WebSocket`.

You can import it from `fastapi.requests`:
    
    from fastapi.requests import HTTPConnection
    
##  `` fastapi.requests.HTTPConnection [¶](<https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/reference/httpconnection/#fastapi.requests.HTTPConnection> "Permanent link")
    
    HTTPConnection(scope, receive=None)
    
Bases: `Mapping[str, Any]`, `Generic[StateT]`

A base class for incoming HTTP connections, that is used to provide any functionality that is common to both `Request` and `WebSocket`.

Source code in `starlette/requests.py`
    
    def __init__(self, scope: Scope, receive: Receive | None = None) -> None:
        assert scope["type"] in ("http", "websocket")
